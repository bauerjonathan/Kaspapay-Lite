# 🔐 KaspaPay Lite – Simple KAS Payment Widget + API

**KaspaPay Lite** is a lightweight, self-hostable solution to accept **Kaspa (KAS)** payments directly on any website – no third parties, no fees, and no KYC involved.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

KaspaPay Lite consists of two parts:

- A **JavaScript widget** that can be easily embedded into any website (just like a YouTube video or Stripe button)
- A simple **Node.js + Express API** that creates payment sessions and tracks their status using the Kaspa blockchain

This makes it easy to accept one-time payments for digital goods, donations, or services – with funds going directly into your Kaspa wallet.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The backend creates a **payment session** with amount, target address, and optional memo.
2. The widget displays a **QR code** with the payment information on the client’s website.
3. The backend checks the blockchain (via kaspad RPC or WebSocket) for the incoming transaction.
4. Once confirmed, the widget updates the status automatically (e.g. “Paid ✅”).
5. Optionally, the API can **trigger a webhook** to unlock content or trigger further actions.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Donations for content creators or open-source projects
- Selling downloadable content (ebooks, PDFs, license keys)
- Paywall for digital services (events, subscriptions)
- Simple crypto checkout for personal or small-scale shops
